                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p1>Welcome to our team's website! We are a group of four software engineering students from Stevens Institute of Technology, passionate about education and making learning fun. Our goal is to teach children important coding concepts and practices through interactive and engaging games.</p1>
                <p1>Each member of our team brings a unique set of skills and experience to the project. As software engineering students, we have learned the importance of good coding practices, and we want to share that knowledge with the younger generation. Our team is made up of Andrew Quinlan, Vincent Tufo, Jonathan Morrone, and Ryan Mercadante.</p1>
                <p1>We have developed a collection of eight games, each representing a different common performance issue within coding. The games are designed to be both entertaining and educational, allowing children to learn while having fun. Our hope is that the website will inspire a new generation of coders and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to become successful software engineers.</p1>
                <p1>Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope you enjoy playing our games! If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p1>
